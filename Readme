Name: A Volumetric Image Manipulation Tool using raw pointers


Description: 
This program is designed to manipulate a sequence of .raw files. The goal was to build a volumetric image tool, which can load a stack of 2D images and manipulate them as a group.

Instructions: Extract the tar file to program directory. Enter 'make' to compile.
To run the program, enter one of the following commands:

  ./ volimage <imageBase> //to print out the number of images and number of bytes used
  ./ volimage <imagebase> -g i output_file_name //to extract the ith row of all slices to output_file_name with corresponding header.
  ./ volimage <imageBase> -x i output file name //to extract the ith slice to output_file_name with corresponding header.
  ./ volimage <imageBase> -d i j output_file_name //to create a .raw output file with the difference between slice i and j.
 
Enter 'python viewer.py <raw filename> <width> <height>' to view the output image.
 
List of files: volimage.h, volimage.cpp, driver.cpp, and viewer.py.
